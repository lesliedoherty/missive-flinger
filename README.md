# Missive Flinger

[Mrs Flinger](http://mrsflinger.com/) really wants to receive iOS notifications at regular intervals throughout the day, containing a random quote from her collection; don't ask me why.

It occurred to me that you could probably achieve this with a service such as [My Notifier](https://mynotifier.app)[^1], and a GitHub Action. I cobbled this proof-of-concept together in a couple of hours, beecause I'm a nerd who can't pass up a good pun.

[^1]: You could also [use Hap](https://github.com/monooso/hap), if I spent my time building that, instead of dumb things like this.
